There was an influx in demand domestically and internationally. We got some orders from Hong Kong or Taiwan, if I'm not mistaken. But to properly pass customs clearance and deliver to the customer, each carton of that particular test kit had to be attached with 2 documents: a commercial invoice (CI) and packing list (PL).

It might seem like just 40 sets, but it took over 2 hours, resulting in teary, red eyes and neck pain for my colleague to finish that task.
